# How to Contribute

It's relatively simple! Take a look at the [documentation](https://api.norcapsecurities.com/admin_v3/documentation),
find which endpoint hasn't been covered yet. Normally, you will want to do the following on github:

1. Open an issue

2. Open a pull request addressing the issue

3. Create the following file:

   - `/{project directory}/ENDPOINT.go` - function file to call the api endpoint

4. Await the PR to be approved!
