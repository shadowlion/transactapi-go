# TransactAPI Golang SDK

TransactAPI is a RESTful API that enables broker-dealers, funding platforms, and issuers to conduct online private securities offerings. Our standards-based API toolkit can be quickly and easily integrated with proprietary platforms, saving development time and money. Issuers, intermediaries, and advisors can benefit from TransactAPIâ€™s straight-through processing of private placement transactions, which enables higher transaction volumes, expands access to investors, and reduces processing times.

This is a golang API wrapper for endpoints as specified in the [documentation](https://api.norcapsecurities.com/documentation) of Transact API, provided by [North Capital Private Securities](https://www.northcapital.com/) (NCPS).

## Author's Notes

This is in no way an official SDK provided by the company itself. However, since I use a lot of golang in my daily work life, I figured I could create a library and share it with others in a more open-source format.

## Development

You will need to acquire both a `clientID` and `developerAPIKey` from NCPS in order to use this for actual financial services - this happens when you subscribe to them as a customer of their services. However, you DO NOT need a `clientID` nor `developerAPIKey` from NCPS to develop this library, as we use mocks from their documentation to test each endpoint.

## Installation

WIP

## Usage

Please take a look at `./cmd/example/main.go` for details on usage.
